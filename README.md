A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course platform where the users have free access to online courses. When compared to the traditional course materials, the MOOCs are interactive that allows the users to enhance their knowledge by participating in social media discussions. EdX, Coursera, and Udacity are few notable MOOC providers. One of the main challenges that MOOC providers face is to understand how well the users are satisfied with the courses and which courses have not satisfied the users. Although many users review the courses in the online course platform, it is tough to analyze each review. In this project, we use the Coursera user review data to build the classification models that can classify the user reviews based on the polarity. A web application is created where the members of MOOC providers input the customer review and the application outputs the polarity of the review.
